Flowee the Hub repository
=========================

# Building a Hub that connects you to Bitcoin

As the first and most valuable crypto currency in existence Bitcoin is
still a mysterious black box to most companies that would potentially want
to use it or build applications on top of.

Flowee is being built to help you connect to the Bitcoin network and handle all
the validation, parsing and low level database access for all your Bitcoin
needs. Including many needs you didn't even know you had!

The codebase is derived from the one that originally was created by Satoshi
Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. This way you know you won't get
compatibility issues. Flowee is adjusted for greatly increased speed and
reliability as well as for scaling up to much larger blocks than the
competition.
