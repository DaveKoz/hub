## These descriptors are used for Gitian.

This is a buildsystem that allows you to build Bitcoin Classic in a way
that only the most basic dynamic libraries are required, everything else is
statically linked allowing for downloads to be stand-alone.

Please refer to
[gitiab-building](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/documentation/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)
for instructions on how to get started.
